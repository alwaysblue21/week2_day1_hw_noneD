What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
// A parameter is a variable that is declared in a function definition. It is a placeholder for a value that will be passed to the function when it is called. An argument is the value that is actually passed to a function when it is called.

Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
// The main difference between return and console.log is that return returns a value from a function, while console.log simply logs a value to the console.
